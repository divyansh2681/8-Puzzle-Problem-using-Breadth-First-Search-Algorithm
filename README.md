Project 1 - ENPM 661 - Planning for Autonomous Robots

Name: Divyansh Agrawal 

Goal: Solve 8 Puzzle Problem using Breadth First Search Algorithm 

Work: In this project, I have created a python file which solves a 8 puzzle problem. This was done using breadth first search algorithm which is an exhaustive method, that is all the nodes are created until the goal is reached. The initial state and goal state have been written in the 'initialization' function. Please change them according to your requirements. You can open the file in any python editor and then run it.
